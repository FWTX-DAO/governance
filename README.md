### Introduction

This proposal aims to provide a concrete initial governance framework for The FWTX DAO. Building on discussions from our recent meetings, we present the following guidelines.

### 1. Voting Membership

#### There are two paths to qualify for active membership:

1. Attendance at DAO meetings or events.
   - Must have attended at least one event within the last 6 months to retain membership via this path.

2. Contribution towards the DAO:
   - Initial pre-approved categories of contribution include:
     - Committee participation
     - Organizing Local meetups & supporting Texas Blockchain Council
     - Technical contributions
     - Social media contributions
     - Hosting, volunteering, or organizing events
   - Must have made at least 1 qualifying contribution in the last year to retain membership via this path.

#### Membership Management:

- We will introduce a Membership Committee. The Membership Committee will:
  - Track attendance at DAO events.
  - Maintain records of active contributions
  - Meet quarterly to update the list of active members, based on event attendance and contributions.
  - Propose changes to the list of approved ways to contribute.
  - The membership committee will have 3 members: a chairperson and 2 others.

### 2. Voting Structure

- Ranked Choice Voting will be implemented.
- All members will start with an equal weight vote.
- We will likely want to introduce weighted voting in the future (for example, members of the EthDFW planning committee might have their votes counted more for votes related to how EthDFW operates).

### 3. Voting Thresholds

- Initially, a simple majority (50%) of votes cast will be required for all votes.
- In the future, changing the voting or governance process itself might require a higher voting threshold.
- A quorum requires participation from at least 10% of all eligible voting members.

### 4. Calling for Votes

- Initially, any member can call for a governance vote on some issue.
- In the future, it is recommended to eventually transition to sponsored voting, where a sponsor from an elected committee member is needed to call a DAO-wide vote.

### 5. Voting Technology

- A Telegram bot, linked to the membership database, will be employed for voting.
- This will be the top priority to get implemented by the tech committee if this proposal is accepted.

### 6. Objectives
- Leverage Github educational assets for Fort Worth branded content
- Governance & Security oriented around FW locality/inclusivity

### Action Items

- Establish a membership database to track attendance, contributions, and membership status.
- Ensure the maintenance of the telegram voting bot and ranked choice voting script.
- Introduce a mechanism to cross-check votes with the membership database.
- Set up the Membership Committee with a chair and two other members. The committee will:
  - Regularly update the member database.
  - Ensure adherence to membership rules.
  - Propose changes to the membership criteria, subject to broader governance approval.

### Recommended Initial Committees

1. Membership Committee
   - Mandate: Maintain the roster of members quarterly.
   - Must be elected within 3 months of when this proposal passes, so that it can review membership according to the new rules (which require reviewing the list of active members every 3 months)

2. Governance Committee v2.0
   - Mandate: Propose an operating framework for the DAO, including constitution/bylaws, committee creation process, appointment procedures, and more.

3. Tech Committee
   - Mandate: Oversee the DAO's tech stack.
   - Initial tasks: Build a membership database and ensure the functionality of the Telegram bot and voting script.

### Special Addendum: Bootstrapping Membership

To ensure that we can begin using this new governance system right away after this proposal is passed, we need to have an initial set of voting memberships who can pass governance proposals, including to elect the important committees like the membership committee and the next iteration of the governance committee. To that end, we will declare anyone who has RSVPâ€™d to a FWTXDAO meetup Partiful event within the last 6 months an active member. 3 months after this proposal passes, the membership committee will review the list of active members according to the new membership rules as laid out in this proposal. By approving this proposal, the DAO commits to electing a membership committee within the next 3 months to handle maintaining the list of active members that are eligible to vote.
